This web app, intended for testers, makes crash reports submitted by a Firefox
OS device accessible.

This app is destined to be listed in the Firefox Marketplace,
but not developed far enough yet.

The main repo is http://git-public.kairo.at/?p=aboutcrashes.git;a=summary but
it's listed on GitHub at https://github.com/KaiRo-at/aboutcrashes for
convenience for potential contributors. See the TODO for tasks that you can help
with.

Please don't use GitHub for issue tracking but http://bugzilla.kairo.at/
